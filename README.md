# Task-1-Categorical-Variable-Distribution-Visualization
This project explores the distribution of categorical variables in the tips dataset using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. The dataset contains information about restaurant bills, including total bill amount, day of the week, time of day, gender, and smoker status.

# Introduction
Understanding the distribution of categorical variables is essential for gaining insights into the characteristics of the dataset. This project aims to visualize the distribution of various categorical variables using different types of charts.
# Project Overview

The project utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations for the following categorical variables:
•	Gender distribution
•	Smoker status distribution
•	Average total bill by day of the week
•	Total bill distribution by time of day
•	Histogram of total bill distribution

# Charts Included
1.	Count Plot for Gender Distribution: Visualizes the count of male and female customers.
2.	Pie Chart for Smoker Status: Shows the percentage of smokers and non-smokers.
3.	Bar Plot for Average Total Bill by Day: Displays the average total bill amount for each day of the week.
4.	Box Plot for Total Bill Distribution by Time of Day: Illustrates the distribution of total bill amounts for lunch and dinner times.
5.	Histogram for Total Bill Distribution: Represents the frequency distribution of total bill amounts.
